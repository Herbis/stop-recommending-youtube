# Stop Recommending for YouTube
 This Chrome extension is made to reduce mine (and maybe yours) bad habits - doom scrolling, and going down the rabbit hole on YouTube. It still allows for normal use cases for YouTube like watching from your home or subscription pages. It only prevents scrolling to next / moving to next short, recommending shorts in general, and recommending other videos in the right side panel of the video. 
 This is an open-source project. No data is collected. 

## Features
* Stops recommending Shorts on your Home / Subscriptions pages.
* Makes the left navigation panel smaller / simpler.
* Removes the right panel (with recommended videos) when on a YouTube video page.
* Removes ability to navigate to another Short when watching a Short.
